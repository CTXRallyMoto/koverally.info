The stock handlebars have a thinner wall than most. Handguards tend to come with 14mm spacers. It has been reported that 17mm spacers that come with the Acerbis and Cycra ProBend fit without any modifications.

The stock mounts are of a PDHS variety and have a special mechanism for shock absorption. It has been reported that Highway Dirt Bike is working on a special top clamp to work with the PDHS, and allow you to run their beefy handguards.

If you want to change the handlebars you need to know that the stock controls have locating pins in them, and the stock handlebars have locating holes. Your options to change bars are to drill locating holes when you determine the best location on your new bars, or to dremel off the pin from the controls. If you dremel off the pins, you will probably want to use a bit of tape to make the controls friction into place.
