### Oil

The 450 Rally does not have an oil sight glass. To deal with that, [Joe Henner](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1137977753521359/user/100001246029949/) of Kove Moto USA demonstrates how to check the oil.

Alternatively, there are two options available that add either a sight glass, or a check screw:
- [Sight Glass option](https://unclewang.net/products/450rally-engine-side-cover-with-observation-window) - this is a deeper side cover though, and could interfere with the brake pedal.
- [Camel ADV check screw option](https://camel-adv.com/collections/parts-for-your-kove/products/kove-450-clutch-cover) - billet aluminum, with a screw at the fill level.
